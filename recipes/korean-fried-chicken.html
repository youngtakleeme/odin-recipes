    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Nicknamed “candy chicken,” Korean fried chicken is known for its
      addictively crunchy exterior and its thick sweet-and-spicy sauce. These
      bites pack a little capsaicin punch, so feel free to decrease the amount
      of dried chilis that go in. But if you like your adrenaline kick like I
      do, please enjoy the sweet-and-spicy ride.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make wings: In a deep pot over medium-high heat, heat 4 to 6 cups
        vegetable oil to 275°. Line a large plate or baking sheet with paper
        towels. In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, baking powder, and garlic
        powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat wings dry with paper towels, then rub with grated ginger and season
        with salt mixture. In a large bowl, toss wings with cornstarch and
        squeeze to compress coating onto each wing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully add wings to oil and fry until skin is just lightly crisped
        and golden, occasionally flipping with tongs, about 15 to 18 minutes.
        Remove wings from oil and set aside on prepared plate. Let rest briefly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat frying oil to 400°. Return wings to pot and fry again until deeply
        golden and skin is crisp and crunchy, about 7 to 8 minutes. Remove wings
        from oil and place in a large mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, add butter, dried
        chilis, ginger, and garlic and cook until fragrant, 2 minutes. Stir in
        gochujang, ketchup, vinegar, and soy sauce and cook until bubbling. Stir
        in honey and brown sugar and continue cooking until bubbling and
        slightly thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour sauce over wings and toss until evenly coated. Add in peanuts and
        toss to combine.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and green onion before serving.</li>
    </ol>
