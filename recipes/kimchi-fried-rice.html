    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe has six ingredients, but it’s all about the rice and the
      kimchi. If there are any leftover rice containers from last night’s take
      out, fried rice begs to be on the menu. If you also have ripe kimchi on
      hand, there is no better time to make kimchi fried rice.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 c. chopped kimchi</li>
      <li>1/3 c. kimchi juice, divided</li>
      <li>4 c. steamed rice, leftover and refrigerated preferred</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. gochujang (korean red pepper paste)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>4 scallions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 fried eggs (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add bacon to a cold, large non-stick pan; warm over medium heat. When
        the bacon fat has mostly rendered, about 10 minute, turn up heat to
        medium high and cook until bacon is crispy
      </li>
      <li>
        Add kimchi and cook for 1 minute. Fold in rice and break up using a
        wooden spoon. Mix in remaining kimchi juice and gochujang, until well
        combined. If the rice is dry, add a few tablespoons of water. Fry until
        warmed through, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat, stir in sesame oil. Divide among 4 bowls, garnish with
        scallions and serve immediately.
      </li>
      <li>Optional: Serve with runny fried egg on top.</li>
    </ol>
