    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      In Korean, bibimbap literally means mixed rice. And you'll often see it
      filled with all different types of meats, vegetables, and toppings. Though
      people will typically cook or prepare each individual item that will be
      placed on their own bowl of fluffy white rice, by using a sheet tray, you
      can eliminate half that work. For this recipe we arranged mushrooms,
      carrots, zucchini, and marinated beef on a sheet tray, but you could sub
      in more or less anything you want. Asparagus? Sure. Chorizo? You bet.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <h4>For Banchan</h4>
      <li>
        In a large pot, bring 6 cups of salted water to a boil. In a large bowl,
        prepare an ice bath. Add bean sprouts and blanche for 1 to 2 minutes
        until just cooked. Remove the bean sprouts using a spider or tongs and
        shock in the ice bath. Drain the sprouts and set aside. Repeat with the
        spinach and give it a rough chop once cooled.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine sesame oil, garlic, sesame seeds, and salt. Add
        sprouts and spinach to their own bowls and cover each with half the
        sauce. Toss to both bowl to coat.
      </li>

      <h4>For Bibimbap Sauce</h4>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk gochujang, vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce,
        garlic, sesame seeds, and brown sugar. Set aside
      </li>

      <h4>For Bibimbap</h4>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400ยบ. One at a time in a medium bowl, toss carrots,
        zucchini, and shiitakes in enough oil just to coat and salt and pepper
        to taste. In a sheet pan, arrange each vegetable into their own
        quadrant, making sure the veg makes as much direct contact with the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wipe out medium bowl, then whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic,
        ginger, brown sugar, a pinch of kosher salt, and 7-8 grinds black
        pepper. Add sliced beef and toss to coat fully.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move sheet pan to oven and roast for 30 minutes, tossing each quadrant
        halfway through, until the beef is cooked through and the veggies have
        begun to brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as you take the pan out of the oven, heat 1 tbsp of oil in a
        nonstick pan over medium heat. Crack eggs into the pan and cook until
        the white is just set and the yolk is still runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, add rice to a bowl and top with one fried egg. Add your
        desired toppings (carrot, zucchini, mushroom, beef, spinach, and bean
        sprouts) arranging around the yolk. Repeat with 3 more bowls and serve
        with prepared sauce.
